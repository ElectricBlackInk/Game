 * A starting point for the COSC 3011 programming assignment
 * Probably need to fix a bunch of stuff, but this compiles and runs.
 *
 * This COULD be part of a package but I choose to make the starting point NOT a
 * package. However all other added elements should be sub-packages.
 *
 * Main should NEVER do much more than this in any program that is
 * user-interface intensive, such as this one. If I find that you have chosen
 * NOT to use Object-Oriented design methods, I will take huge deductions.
